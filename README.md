# 💜 Kind To Mind – Mental Health Awareness Website

For my first project of building a static HTML + CSS website, I built Kind To Mind which is a gentle, supportive mental health awareness website designed to offer practical tips, trusted resources, and emotional encouragement. 

I used Google fonts: Dancing Script	Logo, headings 
and Playfair Display for Section titles, quotes, modals, contact form

and the colour pallette used was chosen to make the website look cheerful, colourful, bright and inviting. Shades of pink and purple were used.
